# US Bitcoin Reserve: Trump's Attempt to Turn Trash into Future Asset  

## Will the US Bitcoin Reserve Pull the Crypto Market Out of the Crypto Crush?  

### US Bitcoin Reserves: Trump's Big Mistake or a Visionary Step  

US President **Donald Trump** signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, reigniting the debate on whether cryptocurrency is on its way to becoming a traditional currency or a future asset.  

Trump's ally **Elon Musk** has also been highly optimistic about cryptocurrency and blockchain, with his own plans. This has fueled speculation and rumors about cryptocurrency, causing Bitcoin's value to surge.  

Before diving deeper, it's essential to understand the nature and simple mechanism of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is completely digital. The idea of digital currency was first introduced by American cryptographer **David Chaum** in 1983. Cryptography was a technique to make message transmission more secure. In 2008, a pseudonymous person or group, **Satoshi Nakamoto**, invented blockchain and introduced the world's first cryptocurrency, **Bitcoin**, in 2009. Blockchain provides a secure, reliable, and transparent ledgering technique. Since then, Bitcoin's value has surged, and many other cryptocurrencies have become part of the crypto exchange. However, no major financial institution or economy has recognized them as traditional currency.  

## Why Crypto Attracts Investors  

Bitcoin started in **2009** at an initial price of **$0.10** and now exceeds **$83,000**. Other cryptocurrencies like **Binance Coin** rose from **$0.10 (2017)** to **$629** today, and **Solana**, which was **$0.6 in 2020**, is now **$129**. **XRP** has also registered significant growth. The total cryptocurrency market value currently stands at **$2.72 trillion**, drawing more investors.  

The cryptocurrency ledger is based on **blockchain technology**, making transactions immutable, secure, and transparent, eliminating fraud risks. Additionally, as crypto remains **unregulated** by national governments, its holders maintain privacy. Since no single government controls its flow, it remains **decentralized**, ensuring investor anonymity. These factors make crypto highly attractive to investors.  

## Are Cryptocurrencies a Good & Secure Investment?  

However, the matter doesn't end here.  

Due to its decentralized and **deregulated nature**, the system is extremely independent. More than **13,000 cryptocurrencies** have been launched, but only **8,000** are actively transacting. Over **35%** of cryptocurrencies have failed due to a **lack of investment**, highlighting the **risk** involved.  

Many cryptocurrencies have negative growth rates. The period from **2021 to 2024** is called the **"Crypto Crush"**, as most cryptocurrencies recorded **negative growth**, leading to investor losses. In **November 2022**, the **Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange "FTX"** went bankrupt.  

The value of cryptocurrency depends on **demand**, which is influenced by investor behavior and market trends. However, due to excessive cryptocurrency launches, supply has increased uncontrollably, impacting demand. Except for a few top cryptocurrencies, most show **poor growth rates**, making market demand unpredictable.  

## Crypto as a Threat to the Global Economy  

Although some governments have introduced **crypto investment regulations**, no country controls it. Crypto is freely transacted worldwide via the **internet**, making it impossible for any government to regulate. Its **decentralized nature** ensures privacy and peer-to-peer transactions, making it a **hub for illegal transactions and black money laundering**.  

According to **Coingecko**, during India's **2016 demonetization**, a large amount of **black money** was invested in Bitcoin, raising its value from **$731 (Dec 2016) to $1,180 (March 2017)**.  

Estimating the exact amount of **black money** invested in crypto is difficult, but it causes **significant tax losses and economic damage**.  

## Crypto Exchange: A Favorite of Terrorists  

Being **unregulated and decentralized**, crypto has become a preferred medium for **illegal international money transfers**. Terrorist organizations such as **Hamas, Al-Qaeda, Jam'at al Tawhid wa'al-Jihad, and al-Nusrah Front** now accept **cryptocurrency donations**.  

Additionally, cybercriminals and online fraudsters **demand ransom in cryptocurrency**. The **biggest reason** behind this is the **anonymity** of crypto holders and the difficulty in tracking transactions. If these transactions were conducted using **traditional currencies**, authorities could track them. However, crypto enables **instant, untraceable** global transactions, making it the preferred choice for criminals.  

## Trump's Obsession with Bitcoin  

The **US government** has seized **21 million Bitcoins** from **terrorist organizations and international criminals**. With this move, President **Donald Trump** aims to **convert these assets into a strategic investment**.  

For the first time, **America will have an alternative to gold reserves in the form of a crypto reserve**. Moreover, the **US government can utilize seized cryptocurrency instead of letting it go to waste**.  

Still, this decision **does not mean** the US government is recognizing cryptocurrency as **official currency**. However, **Fran√ßois Villeroy de Galhau**, governor of the **Banque de France** and a member of the **European Central Bank's Governing Council**, has **criticized Trump's decision**, calling it a **big mistake**.  

Yet, with this move, Bitcoin is undeniably on its way to becoming an **official investment option**.
